# FnC Function

## V1.1
1. Changed the Default Path for the Application from "%Systemdrive%\System" to "%Appdata%"
2. Changed the version control of the FnC by Date. e.g: 20211022 - This string is combination of Date as YYYYMMDD

## v20211212
1. Added Support for Top 8 Popular LICENSES - Now user can delete the Not NEEDED License.
2. FnC now generates the complete project structure, instead of just a file.

## v20211218 - Thank you anic17 for help
1. Added support for dynamically generating AuthorName, as one of the parameters.
2. Improved the Help menu syntax with single line of code.
